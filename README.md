ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @plparadis

I currently work as a Project Engineer at Ecosystem Energy Services USA Inc. 
I'm based out of the Boston office but lives in Vermont and get to work on projects spread across the New England area. 
I specialize myself in energy simulations of complex systems in environments such as university campuses or hospitals. 
I hold a PhD in mechanical engineering from Ã‰cole de Technologie SupÃ©rieure of Montreal.

I mainly use Python to develop small tools and carry out calculations and energy simulations.

you can reach me on my work email: plparadis@ecosystem-energy.com or my personal email: pierre_lucparadis@hotmail.com
